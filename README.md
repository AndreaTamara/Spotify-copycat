## What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

Building this project helped me learn to use and improve my knowledge of some React and JS tools, such as:

- Setting up husky alongside Prettier to make my code so much better :D
- Integrating redux, react-redux and redux-saga to manage my state and perform async actions.
- Creating a .prettierrc file to set up some code conventions.
- Adding static typing with TS to my service-workers and redux code.
- Forwarding refs from one component to another.
- Creating a custom hook to lazy-load the images that come from the API.
- Writing a very reusable pagination component that covers many edge cases.
- Using TS features in a React project and typing my components.
- Managing my service workers with Workbox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

## Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

## How to run the project

#### Pre-requisites âœ…
- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to a `.env` file in root using the environment variables `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**
